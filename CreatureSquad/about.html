    <h1>Creature Squad</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Creature Squad, a simple browser game derived from
      baseball statistics and implemented with <a
        href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> and <a
        href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript.</a> Source
      code is available at <a
        href="https://github.com/libertyernie/CreatureSquad">GitHub.</a></p>
    <h2> How To Play</h2>
    <p>Creature Squad is primarily a game of chance. Game play takes
      place on a board in the center of the screen made of 10 rows, each
      of which are independent of each other. Your objective is to fill
      in squares on the board and then push those squares past the third
      column into the scoring zone.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Each team gets 5 rounds (or more if the score is tied.) A round
      ends when your total number of outs after a turn is 30 or greater.
      Unlike in baseball, <b>the points still count</b> even if you
      reach 30 outs, so the best rounds are usually those where you land
      at 28 or 29 and can get one more turn.</p>
    <p>For each turn, you have two options: attack and sacrifice.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Attack</b> is almost always the best option; you will only
        want to sacrifice in certain situations. The result of an attack
        is calculated independently for each row by using the current
        character's stats, which are based on the statistics of actual
        major league batters. (The default Team 1 lineup mirrors the
        2016 Chicago Cubs and Team 2 is based on their World Series
        opponent Cleveland.)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Each character has two numbers displayed: the success
          percentage (OBP), which reflects how often they avoid outs,
          and the power rate (SLG), which is related to how far into a
          row their squares end up (including outs, but excluding
          walks.) On large screens, these numbers will be shown for each
          character; on small screens, they will be shown for the
          current character only, at the top of the screen.</li>
        <li>The possible results for each row are:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Single: The attack lands on the 1st column, and any square
            that's already in the row moves forward 1 or 2 spaces.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Double: The attack lands on the 2nd column, and any square
            that's already in the row moves forward 2 or 3 spaces.</li>
          <li>Triple: The attack lands on the 3rd column, and any square
            that's already in the row moves to the end and scores.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Home Run: The attack and all other squares in the row
            score immediately.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Walk: The attack lands on the 1st column. Any squares in
            the row move forward only if they are "pushed" forward by
            the incoming square.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Out: The attack does not land on any of the columns, and
            an out is recorded (marked by an X in the leftmost column.)
            However, there is a 1 in 5 chance that any squares in the
            row will still move forward 1 space.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Sacrifice</b>: If you choose this option, you will get an
        out in every row (for a total of 10). However, for each row,
        there is a 50/50 chance that the squares in that row will move
        forward one space. You might want to consider using a sacrifice
        when one of the following is true:<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The character about to attack does not have a very good
          chance of success (for example, Tomas only has an 18.5%
          success percentage, so on average he will get an out on 81.5%
          of the rows, or 8.15 outs per turn.)</li>
        <li>You are at somewhere around 28 outs, so this is probably
          your last turn before the end of the round, and there are a
          bunch of squares in the third column.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Team customization</h2>
    <p>You can define your own teams in the team setup window.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each team is a JSON array. Each element in the array can have the
      following attributes:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Character Info</li>
      <ul>
        <li>name</li>
        <li>fullName (optional, otherwise "name" will be used)</li>
        <li>thumbnail (optional)</li>
        <li>image (optional, otherwise "thumbnail" will be used)</li>
        <li>bgcolor (optional, otherwise one will be chosen based on the
          name)</li>
        <li>description (an array of strings - each will be a paragraph
          on the character description window)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Statistics (you can get these from baseball-reference.com)<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>at_bats</li>
        <li>total_hits</li>
        <li>doubles</li>
        <li>triples</li>
        <li>home_runs</li>
        <li>walks</li>
        <li>hit_by_pitch</li>
        <li>sacrifice_hits<br>
        </li>
        <li>sacrifice_flies</li>
        <li>intentional_walks</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
